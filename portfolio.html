        <h4>About</h4>
        Born and raised in Singapore, I was always brought up to follow The
        Standard Path™ which is to get a university degree and work. However at
        19, I decided to enter the workforce as soon as possible so I could make
        my own money. I loved arts and expressing myself but there were not many
        stable jobs readily available in those industries. Because I couldn’t
        find many people similar to me, I started a Tik Tok account sharing my
        experiences to connect with people. Doing Tik Tok taught me a lot about
        how to use my voice to resonate with and attract the right people. I
        applied this knowledge and skillset to work as a social media content
        specialist.
